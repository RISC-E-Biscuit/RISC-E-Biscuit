- 👋 Hi, I’m @RISC-E-Biscuit

- 👀 I’m interested in MCU/SOC embedded/baremetal programming in C/C++ and Assembly language, in relation to audio synthesis/processing/recording.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning to avoid bad code.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on having a quiet life or more serious audio projects.

- 📫 How to reach me ... Just, Don't. Please.
